A major reason to why like open source software is that it gives me a sense of
security. If it is a popular project I know that many have looked at the source
code and therefore it shouldn't do anything malicious. Proprietary software on
the other hand is another story, compiled programs can do a lot and the only
thing that can comfort me is the author's promise to not do anything bad.

Everything harmful a software can do goes through I/O. Pure programming
languages like Haskell show that it is entirely possible to write good software
while completely separating logic and I/O.
